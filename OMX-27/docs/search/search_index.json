They should be fully functional. The microprocessor, LEDs, OLED, etc. are already assembled. Thru-hole soldering is required for the pots, encoder and switches. For the Cherry MX kit - the keyswitches are snapped into the keyplate first (before soldering them). For the Choc kits - the keyplate fits over the switches and it can be attached later. Don't forget to put the spacer layer(s) in-between the main PCB and the keyplate before you solder all the switches. Soldering Tips I work with a fine point or chisel tip on my iron at 380C-400C. With this setup I typically hold the iron on a pad for about 2 seconds and then apply a bit of solder and then hold the iron there for anything 2-3 seconds. You want to watch for the solder to flow around the joint, but not to hold the iron there forever. See Adafruit's guide to excellent soldering for lots of good tips and tricks. Build Video Build/assembly Kit Build Instructions The microprocessor, LEDs, OLED, etc. are already assembled. Thru-hole soldering is required for the pots, encoder and switches. POTS AND ENCODER Snap pots and encoders into place and solder. You may need to gently squeeze the snap-in mounting pins together a tiny bit to get the pots to snap into place. Note - You don't need loads of solder on the lugs - just enough to keep them in place. STOP HERE AND TEST At this point you can do a quick test. Plug into USB power and the OLED should display the startup routine. Then the LEDs will light up in a \"rainbow\" pattern and the main screen will show on the display. Turn the encoder to the right to get to the second page and you can test each of the pots - which should show the CC number and value on the display. If you get random values for the CCs, you may need to check and reflow the solder on the potentiometer pins. If the display does not light up or you don't see LEDs light up when you connect to USB power, double check the Power Switch on the right edge of the device. The \"On\" position is towards the USB port. Continue building Case Parts Carefully remove the paper backing from the acrylic base plate and set it aside. If the brown paper backing material does not come off easily, you can often rub your finger along the surface to get the paper backing to \"roll up\" a bit Cherry MX kits have two foam spacer layers. The Choc kit has one foam spacer layer. For the Cherry MX kit, you will need the PCB \"keyplate\" for the next step. For the Choc kit, set the keyplate aside until later. Key Switch Prep (MX Kit) Check the orientation of the switches. The pins go towards the bottom-half and the LED window is at the top. Snap all the key-switches into the keyplate (from the top - keyplate top has text labels for the MIDI anc CV jacks). The switches may be a tight fit in the keyplate. Be sure they are snapped all the way into place. Set the two black foam spacer layers on the main PCB and align it around the various components. Then set the keyplate with switches into place to be sure all the pins line up and everything is nice and flat. Inspect from the bottom that you have 2 pins sticking out for each switch. You may need to gently bend key-switch pins into place if they got slightly bent in transport. Use the three of included case screws/nuts to fix everything together for soldering. I suggest using the holes down the middle of the case. This will ensure the key switches are held in place for soldering and that everything will remain flat. Key Switch Prep (Choc Kit) Check the orientation of the switches. The pins go towards the bottom-half and the LED window at the top. Insert all the key-switches into the PCB. Switch Soldering I suggest going thru and tack-soldering one pin for each switch (just enough solder to hold it in place). Then for each switch - use your not-soldering-iron hand to fully press each switch with your thumb on the bottom side, and re-heat the tacked solder joint. In some cases the swtich might not have been fully inserted and it will snap into place when you do this. After all the switches look nice, make another pass and solder the other pin for each switch. Make a third pass and add a touch of solder if needed to the pins you tacked in place earlier. Assembly Remove the screws/nuts if you used them earlier and then reassemble with the bottom plate. The nuts fit into the captive cutouts on the bottom plate. There are three longer screws which are used for the USB protector. USB Protector/Cover Add the cover plate with the three remaining (longer) screws/nuts. Knobs Push the knobs onto the pots, make sure the marking on the knob aligns with the marking on the pot. Be carefull not to press the knobs on too hard if you want to change them later. They can be difficult to remove if pressed on too hard. Keycaps Then install the keycaps with the window on the top for the LEDs. MIDI test You can use the browser_test script to show USB-MIDI input to your computer. Then you can check to be sure the pots are sending CCs and that you get MIDI note-ons/note-offs when you test each keyswitch's pads. Be sure you have the oct (octave) set to 4 on the display (change with encoder knob). Also test the Hardware MIDI OUT 1/8\" jack (with an appropriate adapter if needed) and a synth of your choice. Check the MIDI A/B switch position for your particular setup (try both to be sure you have the right one).","title":"OMX-27 version 3"},{"location":"Build-Kit/#omx-27-version-3","text":"","title":"OMX-27 version 3"},{"location":"Build-Kit/#please-read-this-entire-guide-first","text":"","title":"PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE GUIDE FIRST"},{"location":"Build-Kit/#before-you-start","text":"","title":"Before you start"},{"location":"Build-Kit/#notes-reminders","text":"Kit PCBs have been flashed and tested.

Well now you can! In Chord mode, the bottom 16 keys can each be assigned to play a unique chord. UI Views There are two UI views: \"Split\" and \"Full\". This can be changed on page 2. By default, the UI layout is in \"Split Mode\" meaning the right half of the keyboard works like a 1 octave keyboard and the left half will give you 8 chords that can be played. In \"Full\" mode, each of the 16 bottom keys will play chords. Key Modes There are several different modes available which can be switched using the top keys 3, 4, & 5. [Top 3] Play Mode [Top 4] Edit Mode [Top 5] Strum Mode Play Mode [Top 3] Play Mode This mode is where you want to be if you would like to play chords and the keyboard(Split UI Mode) at the same time. Switching to this mode will bring the menu to the first page, displaying a keyboard that shows the notes of the last chord key that was pressed. You can still edit chords through the menu by switching pages. Edit Mode [Top 4] Edit Mode This mode is for editing the available chords and will bring the menu to the chord edit page. When in the edit mode and in the \"Split\" UI view, you can hold down a chord key on the left half and press a key on the right half to set the root note for basic chords. For interval chords, the right half will not change anything. The first two top keys, key 1 and key 2 act as function keys F1 and F2 in this mode. [Top 1 - F1] Edit Chord : Holding F1 and pressing a chord key will enter a edit chord submode. [Top 2 - F2] Copy Chord : Holding F2 and pressing a chord key will save the selected chord to the newly selected chord slot. Strum Mode [Top 5] Strum Mode This mode allows you to strum chords using the encoder. The UI view will change to \"Full\" in this mode. To use this mode hold down a chord key and turn the encoder CW or CCW. Only the last pressed chord will be strummed. Multiple chords will not be strummed. Strum Pot Parameters. In strum mode, the 5 pots are used to change the behaviour of the strum. [Pot 1] Sens - Sensitivity : This determines how much the encoder needs to be turned to trigger a new note [Pot 2] Wrap : If this is off, the chord can be strummed once, if this is on, the chord will wrap back to the beginning like an arpeggio. [Pot 3] Increment / Octave : This is only valid if Wrap is on. If it is, each time the chord wraps the notes will increase by an octave. This value determines how many octaves will be added before resetting. [Pot 4] Sustain : This value determines how long each strum note will be played for. [Pot 5] Not Assigned Chord Key Settings A chord key is either bottom key 1-8 in \"Split\" UI mode or bottom key 1-16 in \"Full\" UI Mode. Pushing a chord key will play a chord, and releasing the key will stop playing the chord. Multiple Chord Keys can be pressed at once, and also combined with the 1 Octave midi keyboard on the right half in \"Split\" UI mode. Each chord key can have a unique chord type, velocity, midi channel, and be routed to one of 5 MidiFX(#midifx) slots. The last chord key that was pressed becomes the selected chord key. This is visually represented on the LEDs as that key will stay lit up Page 4 - Chord Key Settings: These parameters apply to the selected chord key - TYPE : Determines the chord type: Basic BASC or Interval INTV , see section below on chord types. - MIFX : Which MidiFX will this chord be sent to? - VEL : Velocity of the notes in the chord - MCHAN : Midi channel of the notes that this chord gets sent to Chord Types Two types of chords are currently available: Basic and Interval. Basic chords don't have many settings and are quick to tweak. Interval chords have a lot more options and are linked to the current global musical scale. Basic Chords These chords have no relation to the current global musical scale. All the parameters are shown on a single page that will show 4 ghosts. NOTE : Determines the root note of the chord OCTAVE NUMBER : Determines the octave of the root note GHOSTS : The ghosts determine how the chord is voiced. Each ghost represents the order of the notes in the chord. The vertical position of a ghost determines the velocity of that notes. A large white ghost will play a note in the same octave as the root note. A large black ghost will play a note one octave below. A short white ghost will play a note one octave above. SCALE : Determines the scale of the chord. The last scale is called \"Custom\" and will let you manually set the notes in the chord. Custom Chords If SCALE is set to Custom an additional page in the menu will be revealed. In this page you can program up to 6 notes. The first 4 notes will be modified +- an octave, or turned off based on your GHOST settings The value of each note in a custom chord is defined as a semitone from the root note of the chord. For a C Maj basic triad chord, you would set this to RT +4 +7 . RT means root note. Interval Chords These chords are linked to the current global musical scale. If you play an interval chord and it does not sound good, start by seeing if you have a global scale enabled, and make sure it's not chromatic. Interval Menu Page 1 #NTS - Number of notes : How many notes to play, 1 - 4 DEG - Degree : Determines which degree of the the current global scale to start the chord on. If the global scale was C Maj, then Deg 0 would play a chord that starts on C, Deg 1 would play a chord that starts on D, Deg 6 would play a chord that starts on B. OCT - Octave : The octave of the chord is determined by the global octave +- this value. TPS - Transpose : This will transpose the chord by a seminote. Do note that if you transpose a interval chord it will no longer be in scale. Interval Menu Page 2 SPRD - Spread : This determines how many octaves the chord is spread out across the keyboard. ROT - Rotate : This rotates the notes of the chord. for a C Maj Triad, rot of 0 will play C E G, rot of 1 will make E the lowest note, playing E G C+1oct, rot of 2 will make G the lowest note VOIC - Voicing : Changes the voicing of the chord. Still stays in scale, but will shift notes or add additional notes. Interval Menu Page 3 UPDN - Spread Up & Down : This will spread the notes out in a negative octave and positive octave. QRTV - Quartal Harmony : This enables Quartal Harmony. I have no idea what this is doing music theory wise, but it sounds cool. Technically it's bumping the first note up two octaves, the third note up one octave, and the fourth note down 1 octave. It's supposed to separate the notes by 4ths. Menu Pages Menu Page 1 - Keyboard This page will display a keyboard on the screen showing which notes are being played from the last chord key that was pressed. Menu Page 2 - Chord Mode Settings UI : Change the UI View from SPLIT or FULL .

Both USBMIDI (in/out) and hardware MIDI in/out (via 1.8\" TRS jack) are supported. Various \"modes\" can be accessed with the encoder and specific functions, parameters or sub-modes can be accessed with the encoder or key-presses/key-combinations. Note - CV pitch output is limited to about 4.3 octaves. MIDI OMX-27 is a USBMIDI device so a USBMIDI Host is required for USBMIDI connections. It should be plug-and-play with any USBMIDI compatible host. Typical hosts include a desktop/laptop computer, iPad, smartphone, norns, Raspberry Pi, and Retrokits RK-006 (among others). For example, an iPad works great with the Apple camera connection kit or a lightning to USB-micro-b cable (for v1 and v2) or lightning to USB-C cable (for v3). Hardware MIDI TRS output jack is switchable between Type-A and Type-B. Hardware MIDI TRS input jack is auto-sensing and will magically work with either Type-A or Type-B. Sequencer modes currently send MIDI clock and transport control (start/stop) by default. MIDI clock is sent all the time by default. This can be set to off in the MI (MIDI) Mode parameters. Layout Display The OLED display will show various pages of parameters depending on the currently selected Mode. Encoder The encoder is the knob directly to the right of the display. You can use the encoder to modify parameters and change the selected parameter and page. Short press the encoder once to toggle between selecting parameters and editing them. The selected parameter will be highlighted to reflect which mode you are in. Long press the encoder to change to a different mode. Once in mode selection, turn the encoder, then short-press to enter the selected mode. AUX Key The top left key is the AUX Key. In the MIDI Keyboard and Chords modes, holding this key gives you access to shortcuts. In the sequencer modes, this key is a dedicated start stop button. This key is also used in many places to quickly edit a parameter. To do this, hold down aux and turn the encoder to quickly edit the selected parameter without needing to press the encoder. If the encoder was already pressed, it is locked in edit mode and the aux shortcut won't work until you exit by pressing the encoder again. If you are in a submode, the AUX Key can be used to exit out to the main mode. Potentiometers The OMX-27 has 5 potentiometers which are mapped to send continuous controller MIDI messages (CCs). There are 5 banks of CCs available. You can switch banks using the PBNK parameter in the MI and DRUM Modes. Bank A is selected by default with the CCs set to controller numbers 21, 22, 23, 24 and 7 (volume). The CC's can also be reconfigured on device in the CC Config page, which is found on the last page of the MI Mode parameters. You can also configure the CC banks all at once via the web configurator . Key Switches The functions of the key switches changes depending on which mode you are in. In MI Mode, the key switches work like a normal MIDI keyboard. In other modes, the keys have specific functions depending on the mode or submode. Most key interactions should also light up that key's LED. In this documentation keys will be referred to by number, from left to right and position, top or bottom. Mentions of \"White\" or \"Black\" keys are in reference to a standard piano keyboard layout. \"Black keys\" (sharp/flat keyboard keys) The top row (black) keys are referenced as Top 1-10 . The first 2 black keys are Function Keys (FUNC) - F1 - First black key - F2 - Second black key FUNC keys are used to perform various shortcuts depending on the mode. The other black key functions depend on the current mode. \"White keys\" (bottom row) The bottom row (white) keys are referenced as Bottom 1-16 . These have different functions depending on the current mode. For example, in sequencer modes, these are the sequencer step on/off keys. Changing Modes The OMX-27 has multiple modes. Each is independent - only one mode can be used at a time. Long press the encoder to change modes. Sub-Modes Certain actions will cause you to enter a sub-mode, some examples could be editing MidiFX, configuring the pots, or saving/loading presets. If you are in a sub-mode, the AUX key will typically be flashing or red. A quick press of the AUX key will exit the sub-mode. Macro-Modes Macro modes are like sub-modes in that they are an alternate mode. Macro-modes can take over the keys, display, encoder, and pots. Macro modes are specialized modes designed to be used to control external gear like the M8, Norns, and Deluge. You can enter and exit macro modes by double clicking the AUX key in the root level mode. Saving Session State To save your current session to memory, first enter Mode Select by holding the encoder. While this is active press AUX to save. The next time you restart your device, your last active mode will be loaded, and saved patterns and settings will be recalled. Saving is a long operation and not recommended to do while in the middle of a performance. Screensaver After a default timeout (3 minutes), the display will be blanked and in MI Mode a \"screensaver\" animation will show on the LEDs.

This is useful if you want to use the OMX to play an external drum machine or samples, or multiple drum machines on different midi channels, or for any purpose you'd like really, feel free to get creative! The grouping of 26 keys is called a \"Drum Kit\" and you can store up to 8 different drum kits on the OMX. Press any key to play it.

The first two pages on the OMX display can be used to change the settings for the selected drum key. Each key can be configured to send a unique note number, velocity, midi channel, and be routed to one of the 5 MidiFX slots. Yes, you can use multiple MidiFX at once. You could have one drum key be routed to MidiFX 1 which has an arp to play a bassline, another key could go to MidiFX 2 with a different arp to play a melody, then another key could be setup to play a kick drum which is routed to MidiFX 3 which has a randomizer enabled to randomly vary the velocity each time it is played.

The main difference is that instead of each key being a key on a chromatic keyboard, each of the 26 keyboard keys can be assigned to send out a unique note, velocity, and midi channel. This is useful if you want to use the OMX to play an external drum machine or samples, or multiple drum machines on different midi channels, or for any purpose you'd like really, feel free to get creative! The grouping of 26 keys is called a \"Drum Kit\" and you can store up to 8 different drum kits on the OMX. Press any key to play it. A note on will be sent when pushed and a note off will be sent once released. Selected Drum Key - This is the last key that was pressed down, it is visually represented by a flashing LED. The first two pages on the OMX display can be used to change the settings for the selected drum key. Each key can be configured to send a unique note number, velocity, midi channel, and be routed to one of the 5 MidiFX slots. Yes, you can use multiple MidiFX at once. You could have one drum key be routed to MidiFX 1 which has an arp to play a bassline, another key could go to MidiFX 2 with a different arp to play a melody, then another key could be setup to play a kick drum which is routed to MidiFX 3 which has a randomizer enabled to randomly vary the velocity each time it is played.

The top \"black keys\" are as follows: Orange - release all mutes Lime - go to mixer screen Cyan - snapshot load/paste * Magenta - snapshot save/enter selection mode * Red - release all solos Yellow - waveform display Blue - play When M8 is selected from the MCRO parameter - potentiometers send on the M-CH MIDI channel in both regular keyboard mode and in the macro mode. However, notes played on keys send on the currently selected CH MIDI channel. Notes: * M8 must be on the Mixer view for snapshots. Snapshot Load uses the M8 key combo [SHIFT]+[OPTION]. On any view with a grid (song, chain, phrase, table, etc.) this key enters selection mode. Snapshot Save uses the M8 key combo [SHIFT]+[EDIT]. On any view with a grid this key pastes the copied contents from selection mode. Control Page: This page lets you navigate the M8 using the keys on the device instead of the keys on the M8. Top Key 1 and Bottoms Keys 1-3: These correspond to the directional arrow keys. Top Key 4: Option Key Top Key 5: Edit Key Bottom Key 6: Shift Key Bottom Key 7: Play Key The right half of the Keyboard is a 1-octave midi keyboard that sends notes on the same midi channel as when not in macro mode. Norns Macro Mode The Norns macro mode gives you the ability to control the Monome Norns using the OMX-27. In this mode, you can control the three buttons and three encoders using the OMX-27. This is useful if your norns is not located close by and you would like to control it. Find the MCRO parameter in the menu and select NRN to enable the Norns Macro mode. Double click the AUX button to enter Macro Mode. Double click the AUX button again to exit Macro Mode. Norns Setup In order for this to work, you will need to setup the qremote mod on your norns. Obtain the mod here: https://llllllll.co/t/qremote/57549 or install in Maiden ;install https://github.com/Quixotic7/qremote Enable the mod in the mod menu of norns, connect your OMX-27 to the norns and restart. The easiest way to connect the OMX-27 is to simply use a USB port on the norns. The qremote mod will default to using midi channel 10. If you are using defaults, make sure your OMX-27 Macro Channel M-Chan is set to 10. Use the default configuration for encoders and buttons: The default cc\u2019s for the encoders are 58, 62, & 63 The default cc\u2019s for the buttons are 85, 87, & 88 You can change these in the parameter menu. Or edit the script to change the defaults. Norns Buttons These act the same as if pressing the buttons on the Norns. - [Top 3] B1 - [Bot 4] B2 - [Bot 5] B3 Norns Encoders Use the OMX-27 Encoder to control one of the Norn's encoders. Since the OMX-27 only has one encoder, shortcut keys are used to determine which encoder will be controlled. - [Top 5] Enc 1 - [Bot 6] Enc 2 - [Bot 7] Enc 3 Norns Navigation The keys of the OMX-27 are used to emulate up/down left/right keys useful for menu navigation. These work by controlling encoder 1 or encoder 2, sending one tick either clockwise or counter-clockwise. - [Top 1] Up - [Bot 1] Left - [Bot 2] Down - [Bot 3] Right Deluge Macro Mode The latest Deluge Community Firmware has added a new feature called Midi-Follow. https://github.com/SynthstromAudible/DelugeFirmware/blob/community/docs/features/midi_follow_mode.md This mode provides default CC mappings to control many of the synth parameters with a midi controller and to be able to play the active instrument without needing to midi learn everything. This Macro Mode provides parameter banks to control every available parameter on the Deluge using the 5 pots of the OMX-27. The Deluge will also send back the values of the parameters to the OMX-27 which will update the values in each bank on the OMX-27. This will only work if you are connected via USB as the OMX-27 does not have TRS Midi-in. Values are updated when changing them from the gold knobs, or from edit view, when entering a clip view, or when changing a synth or kit. Deluge Setup Download and install the latest Deluge Nightly Firmware: https://github.com/SynthstromAudible/DelugeFirmware/releases . This Midi-Follow feature is not included in the 1.0.1 release. There is also a new beta build released which should have the feature, but it is not confirmed. To install the FW, place the .bin file on your sd card, ensuring there are no other .bin files. Carefully reinsert the SD Card in the Deluge, if it is misangled it can fall into the device. Turn on the Deluge while holding the shift key. Hold Shift + Click the main Select Knob, find Midi, click the Select Knob, find \"MIDI-FOLLOW\", click the select Knob, find \"CHANNEL\", click the select Knob, set each channel to something, I recommend channel 10. Also from the \"MIDI-FOLLOW\" level, select \"FEEDBACK\" and set the channel to 10 as well. For further help see https://github.com/SynthstromAudible/DelugeFirmware/blob/community/docs/features/midi_follow_mode.md OMX Setup Find the MCRO parameter in the menu and select DEL to enable the Deluge Macro mode. Change Macro Channel M-CH to 10 or whatever you set your Deluge to. Double click the AUX button to enter Macro Mode. Double click the AUX button again to exit Macro Mode. KEYS & LEDS The keyboard is split into two halves. The right octave of the keyboard works the same as the midi keyboard from MI Mode and will inherit it's settings. The left half of the keyboard is dedicated to selecting different banks of parameters. Some keys will have multiple banks assigned to them, to access the other banks, click the key a second time.

This is fun to play with with the effects, crank up the bitcrush, delay, or reverb temporally, then press this button to revert it back to what it previously was. - [Bot 8] Revert Bank POT Pickups Depending on which bank is selected, the OMX-27 will send out different CC's for each of the 5 potentiometers. When a change is detected on a pot, the screen will update to show the name of the current bank, parameter, and value that is being sent. In the MI and Drum modes, the pot values that are sent jump to the current position of the pot. In the Deluge Macro, you will need to pickup the value before it is sent. The small triangle on the screen represents the current raw value of the pot, the horizontal bar represents the value for that parameter. You will need to turn the knob left or right to pickup the value. The Deluge can also be setup to pickup, however this macro will work best if the Deluge is set to jump. Encoder The encoder can be used to send out values without needing it to be picked up. To edit a parameter, click the encoder, then turn. There is not currently a visual representation to provide feedback for this. If you click the encoder again, you can scroll to change which parameter in the bank to control. You can also use the AUX shortcuts to quickly jump to parameters, or lightly wiggle a knob.","title":"MIDI Macro Modes"},{"location":"MIDI-Macro-Modes/#midi-macro-modes","text":"Midi macro modes are specialized Midi controller modes designed to be used with specific hardware that can be controlled via Midi.

Pattern Parameters: Sequence Reset Automation This is located on the second page of pattern parameters The goal of this \"Sequence Reset Automation\" feature was developed in the spirit of classic sequencers that can generate more complex sequences from simpler ones by setting any step in a given sequence to trigger a \"reset\" based on some constraint (i.e., number of cycles, probability, random). Note - This behavior is a pattern-based solution. You can also execute step-based resets in Step Parameters. Settings: START (Currently 0 - PatternLength-1): Use this to set the start step in current pattern to reset to for beginning a new cycle. END (Currently 0 - PatternLength-1): Use this to set the last step in current sequence to end/reset pattern cycles. This in essence is the step that will be used to trigger resets.
