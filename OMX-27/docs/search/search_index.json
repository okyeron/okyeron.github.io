They should be fully functional. The microprocessor, LEDs, OLED, etc. are already assembled. Thru-hole soldering is required for the pots, encoder and switches. For the Cherry MX kit - the keyswitches are snapped into the keyplate first (before soldering them). For the Choc kits - the keyplate fits over the switches and it can be attached later. Don't forget to put the spacer layer(s) in-between the main PCB and the keyplate before you solder all the switches. Soldering Tips I work with a fine point or chisel tip on my iron at 380C-400C. With this setup I typically hold the iron on a pad for about 2 seconds and then apply a bit of solder and then hold the iron there for anything 2-3 seconds. You want to watch for the solder to flow around the joint, but not to hold the iron there forever. See Adafruit's guide to excellent soldering for lots of good tips and tricks. Build Video Build/assembly Kit Build Instructions The microprocessor, LEDs, OLED, etc. are already assembled. Thru-hole soldering is required for the pots, encoder and switches. POTS AND ENCODER Snap pots and encoders into place and solder. You may need to gently squeeze the snap-in mounting pins together a tiny bit to get the pots to snap into place. Note - You don't need loads of solder on the lugs - just enough to keep them in place. STOP HERE AND TEST At this point you can do a quick test. Plug into USB power and the OLED should display the startup routine. Then the LEDs will light up in a \"rainbow\" pattern and the main screen will show on the display. Turn the encoder to the right to get to the second page and you can test each of the pots - which should show the CC number and value on the display. If you get random values for the CCs, you may need to check and reflow the solder on the potentiometer pins. If the display does not light up or you don't see LEDs light up when you connect to USB power, double check the Power Switch on the right edge of the device. The \"On\" position is towards the USB port. Continue building Case Parts Carefully remove the paper backing from the acrylic base plate and set it aside. If the brown paper backing material does not come off easily, you can often rub your finger along the surface to get the paper backing to \"roll up\" a bit Cherry MX kits have two foam spacer layers. The Choc kit has one foam spacer layer. For the Cherry MX kit, you will need the PCB \"keyplate\" for the next step. For the Choc kit, set the keyplate aside until later. Key Switch Prep (MX Kit) Check the orientation of the switches. The pins go towards the bottom-half and the LED window is at the top. Snap all the key-switches into the keyplate (from the top - keyplate top has text labels for the MIDI anc CV jacks). The switches may be a tight fit in the keyplate. Be sure they are snapped all the way into place. Set the two black foam spacer layers on the main PCB and align it around the various components. Then set the keyplate with switches into place to be sure all the pins line up and everything is nice and flat. Inspect from the bottom that you have 2 pins sticking out for each switch. You may need to gently bend key-switch pins into place if they got slightly bent in transport. Use the three of included case screws/nuts to fix everything together for soldering. I suggest using the holes down the middle of the case. This will ensure the key switches are held in place for soldering and that everything will remain flat. Key Switch Prep (Choc Kit) Check the orientation of the switches. The pins go towards the bottom-half and the LED window at the top. Insert all the key-switches into the PCB. Switch Soldering I suggest going thru and tack-soldering one pin for each switch (just enough solder to hold it in place). Then for each switch - use your not-soldering-iron hand to fully press each switch with your thumb on the bottom side, and re-heat the tacked solder joint. In some cases the swtich might not have been fully inserted and it will snap into place when you do this. After all the switches look nice, make another pass and solder the other pin for each switch. Make a third pass and add a touch of solder if needed to the pins you tacked in place earlier. Assembly Remove the screws/nuts if you used them earlier and then reassemble with the bottom plate. The nuts fit into the captive cutouts on the bottom plate. There are three longer screws which are used for the USB protector. USB Protector/Cover Add the cover plate with the three remaining (longer) screws/nuts. Knobs Push the knobs onto the pots, make sure the marking on the knob aligns with the marking on the pot. Be carefull not to press the knobs on too hard if you want to change them later. They can be difficult to remove if pressed on too hard. Keycaps Then install the keycaps with the window on the top for the LEDs. MIDI test You can use the browser_test script to show USB-MIDI input to your computer. Then you can check to be sure the pots are sending CCs and that you get MIDI note-ons/note-offs when you test each keyswitch's pads. Be sure you have the oct (octave) set to 4 on the display (change with encoder knob). Also test the Hardware MIDI OUT 1/8\" jack (with an appropriate adapter if needed) and a synth of your choice. Check the MIDI A/B switch position for your particular setup (try both to be sure you have the right one).","title":"OMX-27 version 3"},{"location":"Build-Kit/#omx-27-version-3","text":"","title":"OMX-27 version 3"},{"location":"Build-Kit/#please-read-this-entire-guide-first","text":"","title":"PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE GUIDE FIRST"},{"location":"Build-Kit/#before-you-start","text":"","title":"Before you start"},{"location":"Build-Kit/#notes-reminders","text":"Kit PCBs have been flashed and tested.

See the original Grids Manual [or a video ?] for more. Grids is a 4-channel/instrument MIDI trigger generator specialized in the creation and sculpting of rhythmic patterns. The \"grid\" refers to a map or library of preset drum patterns arranged in a 5x5 grid - which you can steer using X/Y controls. Typical drum use would be Bass Drum, Snare, Closed HiHat, Open HiHat (The default note numbers are mapped to these in the GM drum map). Quick Keys Grids has many quick keys. Pressing these keys quickly jumps the display to select a specific parameter which can be adjusted with the encoder.

MidiFX can currently only be used within the: MIDI (MI), Chord (CH) and Euclidian (EL) modes. MidiFX currently only work on internally generated midi, but may support external midi coming in from USB in the future. MidiFX are arranged in groups of 8 MidiFX. A group of 8 is called a MidiFX Group. In the MI Mode, midi notes generated by playing the keyboard can only be routed to one MidiFX Group. In the sequencer modes, midi notes can be routed to different MidiFX groups by track. Think of a MidiFX group as a pedalboard for Midi. Midi data comes in from the left and go to MidiFX slot 1, then out of slot 1 to slot 2, until slot 8, then out of the device. You can change the active MidiFX group in the MI Mode and the Chord modes by holding aux and pressing one of the Top Keys 6-10.

Pattern Parameters: Sequence Reset Automation This is located on the second page of pattern parameters The goal of this \"Sequence Reset Automation\" feature was developed in the spirit of classic sequencers that can generate more complex sequences from simpler ones by setting any step in a given sequence to trigger a \"reset\" based on some constraint (i.e., number of cycles, probability, random). Note - This behavior is a pattern-based solution. You can also execute step-based resets in Step Parameters. Settings: START (Currently 0 - PatternLength-1): Use this to set the start step in current pattern to reset to for beginning a new cycle. END (Currently 0 - PatternLength-1): Use this to set the last step in current sequence to end/reset pattern cycles. This in essence is the step that will be used to trigger resets. FREQ of trigger reset (i.e., every X sequence cycle iterations) PROB of triggering reset (percentage) NOTE: Setting STEP = 0 and PROB = 1 dictates random trigger steps which can lead to interesting results by jumping to random position/step.","title":"Pattern Parameters"},{"location":"Pattern-Parameters/#pattern-parameters","text":"Long press Pattern Key to enter Pattern Params Mode.

Parameters: Page 1: - PTN : selected pattern - LEN : pattern length - ROT : rotation - CH : midi channel Page 2 (see Sequence Reset Automation below): - START : steart - END : end - FREQ : frequency - PROB : probability Page 3: - RATE : default note length (1/64th to whole note) - SOLO : MIDI solo Keys/Commands: - Step Keys set pattern length - F1 + pattern copies pattern - F2 + pattern pastes pattern (to other pattern slot) - F1 + F2 + pattern clears the pattern back to GM drum map default (and clears all plocks) (you can paste multiple times - paste buffer should stay the same until you copy again) MIDI solo: Set a pattern to MIDI solo and you can play the keyboard while that pattern is selected. Note - once in MIDI solo, you will only be able to change the active pattern by using the encoder knob.","title":"Pattern Parameters"},{"location":"Pattern-Parameters/#pattern-parameters-sequence-reset-automation","text":"This is located on the second page of pattern parameters The goal of this \"Sequence Reset Automation\" feature was developed in the spirit of classic sequencers that can generate more complex sequences from simpler ones by setting any step in a given sequence to trigger a \"reset\" based on some constraint (i.e., number of cycles, probability, random). Note - This behavior is a pattern-based solution. You can also execute step-based resets in Step Parameters. Settings: START (Currently 0 - PatternLength-1): Use this to set the start step in current pattern to reset to for beginning a new cycle. END (Currently 0 - PatternLength-1): Use this to set the last step in current sequence to end/reset pattern cycles. This in essence is the step that will be used to trigger resets. FREQ of trigger reset (i.e., every X sequence cycle iterations) PROB of triggering reset (percentage) NOTE: Setting STEP = 0 and PROB = 1 dictates random trigger steps which can lead to interesting results by jumping to random position/step.","title":"Pattern Parameters: Sequence Reset Automation"},{"location":"Sequencer-1/","text":"S1 - Sequencer 1 \"Black keys\" (sharp/flat keyboard keys) The first 2 black keys are Function Keys (FUNC) - F1 - First black key - F2 - Second black key The next 8 are Pattern Keys and they select the active sequence pattern (P1-P8).
